- [x] Implement a `LogindInspector` (e.g., using `zbus`) that, given a UID, returns the active session id/path plus recovered environment data (display string, runtime dir, synthesized DBus address) and unit tests for the selection heuristics.
- [x] Extend `run_secret_service_helper` (and its caller) to accept injected environment pairs, set them in the child process before dropping privileges, and log which session/seat were reused; include regression tests covering env propagation and timeout handling.
- [x] Wire the inspector into `pam_chissu` so Secret Service gating populates missing `$DISPLAY`/`$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`/`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` before invoking `fetch_embedding_key`, and ensure logind failures surface structured warnings while still returning `PAM_IGNORE` when Secret Service stays unreachable.
- [x] Update README/docs (and any troubleshooting guides) to explain the new logind dependency, how to verify `loginctl list-sessions`, and what operators should expect in syslog when environment recovery fails.
- [x] Run `CARGO_HOME="$(pwd)/.cargo-home" cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace` (plus `-p pam-chissu`) before submitting the change, capturing any new test fixtures for the helper/env logic.
