## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Tag-triggered Deb Packages
GitHub Actions MUST produce Debian-compatible packages whenever a semver tag is pushed.

#### Scenario: Tag push builds packages
- **GIVEN** a tag named `v1.2.3` (pattern `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`) is pushed to the repository
- **THEN** a workflow runs on `ubuntu-latest`, checks out the code, installs packaging dependencies (`debhelper`, `dpkg-dev`, `curl`, `bzip2`, etc.), ensures `CARGO_HOME="$(pwd)/.cargo-home"`, and invokes `build/package-deb.sh --distro debian` and `--distro ubuntu`
- **AND** the workflow archives the resulting `.deb` artifacts from `dist/`

### Requirement: Release Asset Upload
The workflow MUST attach the generated artifacts to the GitHub Release for the tag.

#### Scenario: Release assets present
- **WHEN** the workflow completes successfully
- **THEN** it creates (if necessary) a GitHub Release for the tag with autogenerated release notes
- **AND** uploads each `.deb` file as a release asset with clear filenames (e.g., `chissu-pam_1.2.3_debian_amd64.deb`)
- **AND** the job fails if upload fails, ensuring missing assets surface immediately

### Requirement: Documented Release Process
Maintainers MUST have documentation explaining how to trigger and verify the automated release.

#### Scenario: README describes tagging flow
- **WHEN** a maintainer reads the release section
- **THEN** they learn to push a `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` tag, wait for the workflow, and confirm `.deb` assets on GitHub Releases, including notes about required permissions and how to re-run a failed job.
