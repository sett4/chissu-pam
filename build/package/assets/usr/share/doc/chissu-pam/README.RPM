chissu-pam RPM README
=====================

This package installs the chissu facial capture CLI (`/usr/bin/chissu-cli`)
and PAM module (`/usr/lib64/security/libpam_chissu.so`).

Post-install checklist:
  * Edit `/etc/chissu-pam/config.toml` to match your camera and model paths.
  * Ensure `/var/lib/chissu-pam/dlib-models/` is writable by the PAM service.
    The `%post` script downloads the dlib weights unless
    `CHISSU_PAM_SKIP_MODEL_DOWNLOAD=1` is set.
  * Add `auth sufficient pam_chissu.so` to an appropriate entry under
    `/etc/pam.d/` once you've verified `chissu-cli doctor` succeeds.
  * Rerun `dnf install ./chissu-pam-<version>.rpm` when upgrading; `%postun`
    keeps your dlib weights unless `CHISSU_PAM_PURGE_MODELS=1` is exported.
