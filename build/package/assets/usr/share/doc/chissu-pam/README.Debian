chissu-pam Debian README
========================

This package installs the chissu facial capture CLI (`/usr/bin/chissu-cli`)
and PAM module (`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/libpam_chissu.so`).

After installation:
  * Edit `/etc/chissu-pam/config.toml` so `video_device`, `pixel_format`,
    `embedding_store_dir`, and model paths reflect your hardware.
  * Ensure `/var/lib/chissu-pam/dlib-models/` is readable by the PAM service.
    The post-install hook downloads the dlib weights unless
    `CHISSU_PAM_SKIP_MODEL_DOWNLOAD=1` is set in the environment.
  * Copy `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` (or another PAM stack entry) and add
    `auth sufficient pam_chissu.so` after your preferred primary auth method.
  * Run `chissu-cli doctor` to verify camera, Secret Service, and model access
    before rolling the module out to production.
